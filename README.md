## Description
Understanding how to make a request call with an API and displaying the results. The user can enter a keyword into the search input and if there are results, it will be displayed to the screen. If there is no results, an error message will show and state the error. Some recipes did not have links attached to their object within the request call, this has been substitued with a "Link Coming Soon" to replace the button.
